# Hi, I'm Michael 👋
**Software Engineer | AI-Assisted Development | Systems Thinker**

I'm a software engineer based in Auckland, specializing in using AI coding agents as part of real-world engineering workflows. With 30+ years of systems-level experience and 8+ years of intensive Python development, I focus on architectural reasoning, agent orchestration, and building production-ready systems.

## 🤖 How I Work With AI

I treat coding agents as force multipliers, not replacements for engineering judgment:
- **Spec-first development** - Write clear, testable specifications before delegating to agents
- **Multi-agent orchestration** - Assign distinct roles (exploration, refactor, validation, documentation)
- **Supervised iteration** - Review and refine agent output to maintain system integrity
- **Human-in-the-loop** - Know when to rely on agents vs when to intervene manually

I use Cursor daily for long-context prompting, code generation, and supervised refactoring of production codebases.

## 🔧 What I Work With

**Languages & Frameworks:**
- Python (FastAPI, Flask, SQLAlchemy, async programming, pandas)
- SQL (PostgreSQL - schema design, optimization, complex queries)
- Bash scripting & Linux systems administration

**AI & Agent Tooling:**
- Cursor (extensive daily use)
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama (local models)
- Function calling, structured prompting, spec-driven generation

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker & containerized deployments
- Linux (daily driver), SSH-based workflows
- Nginx, reverse proxies
- Git for collaborative development

## 🚀 Featured Project

**[EventHub](https://github.com/Treadgold/EventHub)** - Production full-stack platform built with AI-assisted development

This project demonstrates my agent-centric engineering approach:
- PostgreSQL schema with 15+ related tables designed with agent assistance
- Async FastAPI backend with comprehensive API surface
- AI-powered event creation using LLM function calling (GPT-4, Claude, local models)
- OAuth2 authentication, Stripe payments, webhook handling
- HTMX frontend with progressive enhancement
- Dockerized deployment with zero-downtime updates

**Agent Workflow Highlights:**
- Used agents to explore and extend the growing codebase
- Wrote detailed specs before delegating implementation
- Employed agents for schema reasoning and refactor safety checks
- Iteratively reviewed agent output to maintain architectural integrity

## 💼 Professional Background

**Systems-Level Foundation:** 30+ years spanning professional programming (started at 16), Linux/Unix administration, database architecture, and hardware diagnostics. This long arc provides strong intuition about failure modes, edge cases, and system behavior.

**Real-World Engineering:** Built production tools and analytical systems in insurance operations, bridging business requirements with technical implementation. Experience reasoning about messy, real-world systems with ambiguous requirements and human factors.

**Agent-Supervised Development:** Extensive experience using AI coding agents to debug, refactor, and extend non-greenfield codebases while maintaining human control over architecture and correctness.

## 🎯 Core Strengths

- **Systems thinking** - Architecture, data models, failure modes, trade-offs
- **Agent orchestration** - Decomposing complex problems, selecting appropriate agent roles
- **Debugging unfamiliar code** - Tracing logic/state issues, incremental fixes
- **Asynchronous engineering** - Clear written communication, reproducible reasoning
- **Long-context reasoning** - Effective in ambiguous requirements and complex codebases
